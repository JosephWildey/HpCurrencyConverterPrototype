# HpCurrencyConverterPrototype

The origina version "main.cpp" is pretty rough from an OOP standpoint, but it was the first time I wrote CPP code in a while. This repo is really meant to show two things: I can write decent CPP code, and that Python and Java can contribute to decent CPP code.

The goal of this program was to convert Harry Potter currencies into USD depending on two different sets of values: One provided by Reddit, and one provided by some fan site.

## Python
This folder features the Python version of this app, which uses polymorphism perform its goal, and minimal if statements. 

## old_cpp
This is a pretty poorly written C++ app because it doesn't pay attention to the OOP principles.

## new_cpp
It uses polymorphism just like the Python script. It's better written C++ code. Cleaning it up any more would likely be more effort than its worth and require implementing Virtual Copy Constructors. I'm happy with the code as is.
