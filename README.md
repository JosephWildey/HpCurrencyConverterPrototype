# HpCurrencyConverterPrototype

The origina version "main.cpp" is pretty rough from an OOP standpoint, but it was the first time I wrote CPP code in a while. This repo is really meant to show two things: I can write decent CPP code, and that Python and Java can contribute to decent CPP code.

The Python verison featrues the same sort of inheritance and polymorphism that is present in the updated CPP code (HPCurrency.cpp).
