# HpCurrencyConverterPrototype

When I saught to help my friend with his HP Currency Conversion written in Javascript I wrote this little program. It had been awhile since I've programmed and I needed something to visualize before I got to work. It did not take long to finish this project.
However, if it helps please use it and if it could be better please improve it.
