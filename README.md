# HpCurrencyConverterPrototype

When I saught to help my friend with his HP Currency Conversion written in Javascript I wrote this little program. It had been awhile since I've programmed and I needed something to visualize before I got to work. It did not take long to finish this project.
However, if it helps please use it and if it could be better please improve it.

# Python HPCurrencyConverter

This one is denoted with the ".py" extension, and utilizes several OOP concepts (Polymorphism and Inheritance). The code is a bit easier to read this way, though it is not as compact.
