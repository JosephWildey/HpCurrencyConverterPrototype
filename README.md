The origina version "main.cpp" is pretty rough from an OOP standpoint, but it was the first time I wrote CPP code in a while. This repo is really meant to show two things: I can write decent CPP code, and that Python and Java can contribute to decent CPP code.

# Python
This folder features the Python version of this app, which uses polymorphism perform its goal, and minimal if statements. 

# old_cpp
This is a pretty poorly written C++ app because it doesn't pay attention to the OOP principles.

# new_cpp
It uses polymorphism just like the Python script. It's better written C++ code. It could be a bit more cleaner still, but I was too lazy to clean it up entirely.
